It will convert the chart into resource IDs and note events for further processing such as load all resources and/or placing notes on the stage.\r\n\r\nBesides of being a chart parser for a music game, this parser is available for other purposes such as chart analyser too. Feel free to fork and include this into your project.\r\n\r\nThis parser is not 100% accurate, although we are trying to make it as accurate as possible. If anyone found a bug, have suggestions or even patched this parser, welcome to file an issue/pull request back.\r\n\r\nThe reason of creating this standalone repository and library project is because it will be easier to develop, maintain and patch the core. Thus all issues related to the parsing errors and/or new format requests should be reported here instead of BananaBeats main repository.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\n[Artistic License 2.0](LICENSE)",
